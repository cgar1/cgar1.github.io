As my final project I am continuing my previous work on Baltimore City property.
For this process I will be using GeoDa to see if property being sold has a direct
relationship to racial density within neighborhood tracts. My previous work has involved
refining the housing data of any errors and separated the sold property by owner and year. 
The two classes of ownership are independent and non independent based off theseller of the 
property; the listing being clear if it was an individual or company/institution.
I also created gifs of both classes showing visually  where each property was sold from 2000-2010.
These have only been a visual representation and requires a statisticalanalysis to determine if there 
is a significant relationship between the property sold andthe owner of the property.  
Without this knowledge there is still no proof that there is acorrelation between race and sold properties. 
A Moranâ€™s I analysis is going to be runthrough GeoDa to determine if there is any relationship between sold
property densityand neighborhood tracts with varying racial density. To utilize the data i have analteration 
will be needed to the vector data so i may utilize it in GeoDa. Linking thehousing data to the population data
will be required as well. To accomplish this thehousing vector will be converted to points and a number of 
points within a tract will becalculated and finally appropriate columns will be made and joined together 
for GeoDa analysis. This final step will be the final answer to the work i have completed throughoutthe 
semester and will be able to determine if there is any correlation between propertysold and racial density.
