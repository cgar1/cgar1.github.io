[See more details here.](https://cgar1.github.io/Project_1_Coakley.html)

For this project I examined the spatial relation between racial density, poverty percentage, and the quantity of property sold within Baltimore neighborhood tracts.

### Project 2

[See more details here.](https://cgar1.github.io/project2_coakley.html)

In continuation of my previous project I further refined my data to only incorporate properteys that were sold by an individual rather than a corporation or other institution. This was done to better vision sold properteys in a spacial setting with further context. The same was done for properteys sold by corporations or institutions. With the resulting information two gifs were created showing sold properties on a yearly basis.

For a my final iteration of my project I used GeoDa to statistically find if theres a significance between independent/nonindependent properties sold and their relation to racial and poverty density within Baltimore City.
