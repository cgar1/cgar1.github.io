Part 2

![Pt2_weight](https://i.imgur.com/bXDeCde.png)

Setting up the weight that is going to be used for Baltimore. Life expectancy was used as the weight.

![Pt2_regressionclassic](https://i.imgur.com/7woaJpG.png)

A regression model is run to determine if lag analysis or error analysis should be used. The model is run comparing life expectancy to lead toxicity to determine the correlation between the two. The Moran I is slightly positive indicating some clustering occurring.

![Pt2_regressionlag](https://i.imgur.com/q8ba5Sr.png)

A lag model was determined to be the best solution and is then run.

![Pt2_cluster](https://i.imgur.com/I4aNKuj.png)

A cluster map of the data is created to visualize the data.

![Pt2_sig](https://i.imgur.com/3YOdO2H.png)

A significance map of the data is also created.

![Pt2_lisa](https://i.imgur.com/aQpKSKu.png)

Finally a Lisa map is created to further visualize the correlation between the two factors.
